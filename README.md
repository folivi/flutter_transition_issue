# transition_issue

Sample demonstrating an issue with custom transition in flutter. 
When built the first time, the text on the second page is displayed but after a hot restart or reload it disappears. 
To reproduce the bug: 
build and run the app on an iphone real device. 
Click on the button to go to the second page. 
Hot restart the app. Click on the button again. 
The text on the second page doesn't show. 
Strangely the flutter logo is displayed
